# Model Viewer CPP

Program written in CPP for loading + viewing .obj 3D models.

Nearly all of the code is original with the exception of
- STB
  - rect_pack
  - truetype
- glad OpenGL loader

This project is written such that when I learn other rendering APIs I can come back to it and implement those APIs
